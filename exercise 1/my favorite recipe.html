 <li> black cardamon</li>

  if you're missing a spice or two, omit & proceed!
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><!--description-->
  <p> The first thing you do is cook chicken in 1 litre water with all the broth(yakhni) ingredients mentioned above then let the chicken boil in water with whole spices for atleast 20-25 minutes.
 Then seperate the chicken from broth and store the broth(yakhni)for later use.
 In all pulaos, the onions will determine the color of your rice. It's important to be patient with them, stir frequently, and deglaze the pan to help them brown evenly. 
 You also don't want to brown them too much before adding the garlic and ginger paste because they'll continue to brown until you add the acidic ingredients
  like tomatoes and yogurt.
  Add chicken and then saute the chicken so that you can see color go from pale to lightly golden, but not too long or it'll darken.
 Stir in the tomatoes, yogurt, green chili peppers, salt, red chilli powder, tumeric powder, cumin powder, corrinder powder, and garam masala.
 saut√© gently so the chicken doesn't break. Once the oil starts to separate, you're ready to add the broth.
 Add the broth and bring to a boil. you want to ensure basic rice essentials such as gently washing the rice until the water runs clear and soaking atleast 30 minutes.   
 Then drain the rice well so you're not adding any excess water.
 While you're bringing everything back up to a boil, this is a good time to do a final salt test, as the rice has begun to take up some of the salt.
 Now let's move on to the final, never-again-intimidating step: cooking the rice perfectly!
 to start, you want to ensure basic rice essentials such as gently washing the rice until the water runs clear and soaking atleast 30 minutes. 
 Avoid stirring while cooking. Once the rice starts cooking, just let it be.
 When most of the water from the surface has absorbed or evaporated Cover the lid with a cloth you can steam it for 10-15 minutes. </p>
