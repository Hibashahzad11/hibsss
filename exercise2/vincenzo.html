    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <p>Vincenzo is a thrilling mix of dark comedy, crime, and legal drama, with a pinch of romance and plenty of action-packed moments. The story follows Vincenzo Cassano, a Korean-Italian lawyer who works as a consigliere (advisor) for the Italian mafia. After a series of unfortunate events in Italy, Vincenzo returns to Seoul, Korea, with a goal: to retrieve a hidden stash of gold buried beneath the Geumga Plaza, a run-down building that holds more than just secrets.
But when Vincenzo encounters a powerful, corrupt conglomerate (Babel Group) that wants to take control of Geumga Plaza, he realizes that this building holds more than gold — it’s the perfect battleground for his personal vendetta. With his mafia expertise and sharp legal mind, Vincenzo takes on the villainous forces, leading to epic confrontations and unexpected alliances.
In the process, he teams up with Hong Cha-young, a fiery lawyer, who initially works for the enemy but later becomes his trusted ally in his quest for justice.</p>
